> Over the course of 3 years at ProtubeVR, I spearheaded the complete redevelopment of their Companion Application in C++, bringing it to a new level of performance and usability.
> To achieve this, I leveraged powerful technologies such as:

- OpenVR for seamless VR integration
- SFML for efficient multimedia handling
- ImGui for a modern, responsive interface
- Javascript to make a streamers device visualizer
